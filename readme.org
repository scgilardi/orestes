** matrix
   - layer x row x column
   - a row is a 16 bit value; each column is a bit
   - a layer is just four rows

** setup
   - set all rows output low
   - set all columns to input with pull-ups
   - set matrix state to zero
   - set layer to zero

** scan
   - for each row
     - delay
     - read columns for the current row
     - check to see if this row has changed since the last read
       - if so, set debounce for this row to cols; reset debounce counter
     - if debounce counter
       - decrement debounce counter
       - if decremented to zero
         - set the current matrix row to the last read value
